Hello this is my first machine learning project
In which I predicted the gold price using 2 models first in Random Forest Regressor and then in Neural Network Model
I also compared the r2 squared score of both the models which states the perfomance of the model
By comparing both the models Random Forest Regreesor was more suitable for this project which was having R2 error score 0.98 which is good as compared to 0.85 of Neural Network.
